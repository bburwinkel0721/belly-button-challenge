# belly-button-challenge
## General Overview
- We built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
- The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
## Tasks
- Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.
- Displayed the sample's metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
- Updated all the plots when a new sample is selected.
